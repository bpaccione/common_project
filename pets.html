                <h2>Bacon Q Dog</h2>
                <p>Bacon Q. Dog is a 9yr old labradoodle. He prefers to spend his days lounging among the three different beds/couches that his family has gifted him. He enjoys a walk or two around the neighborhood, as long as he can pretend that he doesn't see any of the other animals to avoid the embarrassment of not wanting to admit he has no wolf-like skills in chasing them.</p> 
                <p>At night just as the rest of the family is ready to relax, Bacon suddenly wants to release all of his energy. He will place his toys on a mini couch and frantically drag the couch around, giving his toys "a ride." There is also a lot of rolling. Lots and lots of rolling.</p>

                <h2>Rocky</h2>
                <p>Rocky is a 17 year old cat who enjoys spending his time laying around. He likes watching birds and trying to talk to them. While he loves birds from afar, he is not a fan of any other animals and enjoys terrorizing the dog, Oliver. Rocky is also a big fan of eating</p>
                <P>He will do anything for a treat and likes any and all foods. He will gladly sneak onto the dinner table to sample any and all foods. If he does not enjoy eating the food, Rocky is fine with playing with it instead.</P>

                <h2>Cheeto</h2>
                <p>Cheeto is a cat who likes to eat a lot and play a lot. He has an obsession with his grandpa (human) and tries to get outside every single day. If he isnâ€™t causing problems, he is usually hiding in a seven foot tall cat tree and sleeping.</p>
                <P>Another name for Cheeto is Chicken, because sometimes he sits very scrunched up and ends up looking like a rotisserie chicken. He was nicknamed this by one of his friends, and now he understands it as his own name. He is about six years old and still acts like a younger cat, despite being middle-aged.</P>

                <h2>Oliver</h2>
                <p>Oliver is very focused on two things: eating and getting attention. He is devestated when his owner leaves him. Whether she leaves for the day to go to work or for two minutes to brush her teeth, it all feels like an eternity to him. </p>
                <P>The only circumstance in which Oliver will leave his owner is when food is involved. Oliver is not very brave but he is able to muster up a lot of courage when a treat is involved. He cowered away from a kitten until he noticed she had a full bowl of food.</P>

                <h2>Tucker</h2>
                <p>Tucker is a very friendly dog, he loves to be around people and is always following everyone around.He is white fluffy and moody. He can't go up or downstairs by himself after falling when he was a puppy, he now needs emotional support to go up and down stairs.</p>
                <P>His favorite past times are licking his owners, sunning himself on the couch, people watching through our windows and sleeping. When his hair is long he gets the cutest bedhead after he sleeps or takes naps.</P>
